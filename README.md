# RPG Console Game (Python)

## Introduction
This project started one week after I began learning Python.

My first goal was simple:  
to build a basic battle system.  
As I learned new concepts, I kept adding features and improving the design.

At first, the game was written in a single file (rpg.py) using basic tools like:
- variables
- loops
- functions
- simple conditionals

Over time, I learned more advanced concepts such as:
- ANSI colors for UI
- dictionaries
- error handling (try/except)
- auto-removing and updating values

Around month six, I decided to rebuild the project from scratch.  
This rebuild reflects everything I’ve learned so far, including:
- classes and OOP
- file I/O
- JSON save/load system
- class methods
- basic architecture separation (Player, Inventory, etc.)

This project was not a smooth ride.  
I encountered many errors along the way, such as:
- ValueError
- SyntaxError
- FileNotFoundError
- infinite loops
- recursive imports
- misspelled variables
- broken logic

This rebuild exists to measure my growth:
how far I can improve,  
how far I can go,  
and what limits I still need to break through.

This is a learning project, and it continues to evolve.infinite loops, recursive imports,
wrong function and so much more.

I create this rebuild to see how far
can i improves, how further can i go,
and if i ever stop at one point and
cant go further.

# About the road of lesson i went through
## Phase 1 — Basics
- print, input, variables
- if / else, loops
- Simple battle logic
## Phase 2 — Functions
- def, parameters, returns
- Game loop & menus
- Random enemies, inventory (list)
## Phase 3 — Data & Errors
- Lists, dicts
- try / except
- Cleaner output, fewer crashes
## Phase 4 — Terminal Polish
- ANSI colors
- Better menus & readability
- Player feedback
## Phase 5 — OOP Rebuild
- Classes & objects
- Player / Enemy separation
- Reduced globals
## Phase 6 — Save System
- File I/O
- JSON save & load
- Multiple save slots
## Phase 7 — Refactor (Current)
- Inventory & equipment redesign
- Cleaner architecture
- Preparing advanced systems

# What My plans
- Status effects
- Speed/ATB combat
- Skills & AI
- Pygame version
