# 🗡️ RPG Console Game (Python)
A learning-driven RPG project built from scratch while learning Python
Status: Completed prototype / learning project
Latest Version: v1.6
Platform: Python (Console)
# 📖 Introduction
This project began one week after I started learning Python.
The original goal was simple:
# 👉 build a basic turn-based battle system
As I learned new concepts, the project kept growing — sometimes breaking, sometimes rebuilding — until it became a full learning sandbox for game logic, architecture, and problem-solving.
The very first version was a single file (rpg.py), written using only:
variables
loops
functions
basic conditionals
Over time, the project evolved into a multi-file rebuild using object-oriented design, file saving, and cleaner architecture.
This repository represents that rebuild.
# 🎯 Purpose of This Project
This is not a commercial game.
This project exists to:
measure my growth as a programmer
practice problem-solving and debugging
learn how real systems are structured
understand why code breaks — not just how to make it work
Many mistakes were made.
Many systems were rewritten.
That’s the point.
# 🧠 What I Learned Along the Way
Common Errors I Faced
SyntaxError
ValueError
FileNotFoundError
infinite loops
recursive imports
broken logic
variable shadowing
bad architecture decisions
Each rebuild reduced these problems and improved clarity.
# 🛠️ Technical Evolution
## Phase 1 — Basics
print, input, variables
if / else, loops
Simple battle logic
## Phase 2 — Functions
def, parameters, return values
Menus and game loops
Random enemies
Inventory using lists
## Phase 3 — Data & Error Handling
Lists & dictionaries
try / except
Fewer crashes, safer input
## Phase 4 — Terminal Polish
ANSI colors
Clearer menus
Better player feedback
## Phase 5 — OOP Rebuild
Classes & objects
Player, Enemy, Inventory
Reduced global variables
Cleaner responsibility separation
## Phase 6 — Save System
File I/O
JSON save/load
Persistent player data
## Phase 7 — Refactor (Current)
Inventory & equipment redesign
Improved architecture
Preparing for advanced systems
# 🧩 Current Features
Turn-based combat
Player & enemy stats
Inventory system
Equipment handling
Gold & loot
JSON save/load system
Modular file structure
# 🚧 Planned Features
Status effects
Speed / ATB combat system
Skills & enemy AI
Pygame version (visual UI)
# 🚀 Future Direction
This project is considered a learning milestone.
The next step is rebuilding similar systems using:
- Godot
- eventually Unity / Unreal (learning purposes)
The focus moving forward is:
game architecture
state management
combat systems
engine-based development
# 📌 Notes
This project reflects real learning, not tutorials copied line-by-line
Code quality improves across versions
Early decisions may look messy — they are preserved intentionally
This repository is part of my programming journey
# 🧑‍💻 Author
Built by a student who got bored during holidays
and accidentally made a game.
# 🎯 How to run the game
- download the playable-file
- extract the game
- open the Main.py
- run the code
