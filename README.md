# RPG Console Game (Python)

This project started one week after I began learning Python.

My first goal was simple:  
to build a basic battle system.  
As I learned new concepts, I kept adding features and improving the design.

At first, the game was written in a single file (rpg.py) using basic tools like:
- variables
- loops
- functions
- simple conditionals

Over time, I learned more advanced concepts such as:
- ANSI colors for UI
- dictionaries
- error handling (try/except)
- auto-removing and updating values

Around month six, I decided to rebuild the project from scratch.  
This rebuild reflects everything I’ve learned so far, including:
- classes and OOP
- file I/O
- JSON save/load system
- class methods
- basic architecture separation (Player, Inventory, etc.)

This project was not a smooth ride.  
I encountered many errors along the way, such as:
- ValueError
- SyntaxError
- FileNotFoundError
- infinite loops
- recursive imports
- misspelled variables
- broken logic

This rebuild exists to measure my growth:
how far I can improve,  
how far I can go,  
and what limits I still need to break through.

This is a learning project, and it continues to evolve.infinite loops, recursive imports,
wrong function and so much more.

I create this rebuild to see how far
can i improves, how further can i go,
and if i ever stop at one point and
cant go further.
