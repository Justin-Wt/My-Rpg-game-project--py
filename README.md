This is a project that i start
after a week learning python.

My first iteration for this game is
to make a simple battle system.
Then i started to adding more content
each time i learn something new

Like adding def and some loops.
amd then i start to make something
more complex, colors, auto remove,
try and excepts, dictionaries.
that is the second mode of it,
i called it rpg.py

and then at month 6,
when i start rebuilding it,
i keep learning a new stuff day by day
i learnt classes, oop, I/O, classmethod,
inheritance,json file and more

it wasnt a smooth ride just because i
write the good parts, theres tons
of errors i have encountered,
ranging from ValueError, SyntaxError,
FileNotFoundError, misspelled words,
infinite loops, recursive imports,
wrong function and so much more.

I create this rebuild to see how far
can i improves, how further can i go,
and if i ever stop at one point and
cant go further.
